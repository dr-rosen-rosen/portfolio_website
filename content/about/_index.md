Hello! Thank you for your interest in our work. We're a group based largely in the [Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/armstrong_institute/) at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. 
We focus on understanding and improving how people work together and with technology to create safety in complex work systems. The projects on this site are current and past efforts in this space.

Some of the things we care about:
* The safety, quality, and equity of health care delivery systems
* Safety in other complex and high-risk work domains (like spaceflight)
* The quality of life and well-being of people working in these systems

Our approach(es):
* Respect the insight and expertise of people within a system through participatory collaborative efforts and qualitative methods.
* Use data, of all sources and sizes, in the service of progress, includinng advancing rigorous and practical methods of unobtrusive measurement.
* Apply the fundamental methods of human factors design.
* Use simulation to explore (create new knowledge) and exploit (capitalize on established knowledge)

> We believe there's 

Our work tends to fall into these themes
