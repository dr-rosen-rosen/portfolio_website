Good technology can be a good team member.

The future of work no doubt includes more sophisticated techonlogy that begins to blur the line between tool and team member. We've learned hard lessons about 

#### What we're doing
We've developed tools to help support bedside nurses in the ICU carry out cognitvely demanding work. Currently, tools and systems do not support nurses as they could. One small piece of this puzzle is insulin infusion protocols which require information transfer and mental math to manage. They are time consuming and error prone tasks. Techonology can help. In our project, we:

1. Defined requirements from the clinician perspective  [study here](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F2516043519893228).
2. Conducted observational (time and motion) and interview (FMEA) studies to better define opportunities to redesign the work (manuscript in preparation).
3. Develop rrotype designs, and evaluate them in a simulation study [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2020-011420).
#### What we found

> Well designed automation can eliminate error while simultaneously reducing workload, and improving efficiency, user trust, and perception of usability. 


#### What's next

This was the first of many steps. We're continuing to develop technologies to support safe and efficient care at the bedside.
