Establishing evidence-based guidance for using physiological measures in team settings
<!--more-->

This work cuts across several ongoing projects, but is emerging as a practical and important source of unobtrusive measurement in field settings.

#### What we're doing

1. We published a recent review of the literature [here](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0018720819874160) in Human Factors. There is a lot of exciting work happening, and an immense amount of methodological variation in how that work is being carried out.
2. We're attempting to sort through some of those alternative methods to collecting, processing, and analyzing these data in ongoing projects including [Collective Allostatic Load](/portfolio/cal/) and [astronaut selection](/portfolio/nasa/) projects.
3. This is such a rapidly evolving area. We're currently planning an update to the review to (hopefully) include a meta-analysis which can also inform best practices for measurement and analysis.
