Natural language processing can help make sense of and act on narrative safety event reports.

#### What we're doing

We conducted a proof of concept study using [structural topic modeling](http://structuraltopicmodel.com/) and lexical analysis techniques ([LIWC](http://liwc.wpengine.com/) and [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)) to better support leaders and safety and quality analysts identify important trends in safety event reporting data. 
#### What we found

> Topic modeling helped identify trends in the data that were judged to be important and not well represented in the current systems. Linguistic markers showed promise for generating measures of learning and blame climate from the safety narratives.
