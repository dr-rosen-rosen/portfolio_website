title: Reimagining the Resident Learning Experience
weight: 9
---

The patient-physician encounter remains the cornerstone of medical practice. However, medical residents spend little of their time in direct patient care activities. Traditional rounds have increasingly migrated to hallways and conference rooms. These trends decrease the amount of time available to practice clinical skills and likely have contributed to an overall decline in skills. This decline matters because a large proportion of medical errors are linked to oversights during the physical examination. Limited time with patients may also lessen physiciansâ€™ sense of purpose, likely adding to a rise in burnout, particularly among trainees and junior faculty. We must reexamine the current training environment to jointly optimize clinical skills development and professional fulfillment.

**Our hope is that a data-informed understanding of 'work as is' can drive real change.**

#### What we've done

We are currently using location tracking badges to inform our understanding of the resident educational experience, specifically, how much time residents get to spend interacting with patients. Our [early work](https://doi.org/10.4300/JGME-D-19-00026.1) showed that this approach can reliably capture time at the bedside and other critical aspects of work. Currently, we've conducted [an expanded study over a year timeframe and 95,275 intern hours](http://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.15885) showing that, on average interns spent 13.4% of their time interacting with patients, and 33.3% in physician work spaces. There is significant variance in time at the bedside associated with individuals and with clinical rotations. This indicates that both unit or department level interventions as well as individual interventions may help to increase the amount of time spent with patients. 

#### Ongoing work

We're continuing to learn how to apply location tracking to better capture workflow and activities. We're currently using feedback reports to interns as a means to prompt reflection and discussion about what can be done to better optimize the work and learning environments.
