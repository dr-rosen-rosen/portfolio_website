title: "Teaming across Levels: Simu-Leader"
weight: 7
---

Improving complex systems is hard. Leaders need a way to experiment with system change and improvement. Simulation helps reframe what we can change about our work systems.

More information on Simu-Leader [here](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/armstrong_institute/improvement_projects/health_care_worker_performance/simuleader.html) and a brief description of the program in [Health Management](https://healthmanagement.org/c/hospital/issuearticle/the-simu-leader-programme).

#### What we've done

Our earliest experience with organizational simulations for system improvement are detailed [here](https://journals.lww.com/simulationinhealthcare/FullText/2015/12000/Simulation_in_the_Executive_Suite__Lessons_Learned.7.aspx) in the Simulation in Healthcare Journal.

We've conducted a large scale evaluation of a distributed screen-based simulation with over 1,700 participants globally. We're in final stages of analysis and writing for that project.

> Simulation helps reframe across levels and boundariees in the organization. It is a powerful tool to improve systems thinking and leadership self-efficacy.  

#### Funding
The earliest versions of this work were funded through the CMS' Partnership for Patients Program. Further funding was provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
