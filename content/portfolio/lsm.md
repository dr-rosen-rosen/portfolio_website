Linguistic style matching as an indicator of the quality of patient and physician interaction.
<!--more-->

Higher quality patient-clinician communication is related to improved health outcomes across multiple clinical settings and disease areas. This is true in HIV care where patient perceptions of the quality of interaction with their physician predict the likelihood of keeping appointments and retention in HIV care, as well as adherence to antiretroviral therapy and having undetectable serum HIV RNA. However, the exact nature of high quality patient-clinician communication remains under-specified and speculative. Most studies evaluate patient-clinician communication quality using either global rating scales which limit insights into the specific aspects of communication that patients value, or labor-intensive manual coding of audio files or transcripts which restrict their use beyond funded research efforts. Innovations in computer-assisted text analysis offer potential for a more practical method for generating a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of high-quality patient-physician communication. Specifically, an individual's linguistic style and linguistic style matching (LSM) between conversational partners may address some of the current challenges in conceptualizing and measuring the quality of patient-clinician communication. 


#### What we're doing

Linguistic style, the unique way in which individuals express themselves using language, predicts a broad range of intra- and inter-personal phenomena including personality types, emotional states, motivations, cognitive processes, social positions, cultural backgrounds, and relationships. Further, the degree to which conversational partners match their linguistic styles predicts group processes and outcomes such as cooperation, positive perception of others, and group cohesion. Initial studies of LSM in patient-clinician communication support the notion that this general phenomenon is an important aspect of high quality communication with patients. However, key questions remain about what aspects of style matching matter most. Is the overall degree of matching throughout the entire interaction most important for patientsâ€™ perceptions of quality, or are more nuanced approaches to understanding LSM required? Specifically, does it matter who is matching whom in the interaction, or are trajectories of matching across the duration of the interaction more indicative of high quality communication? *Our current work focuses on answering these conceptual and methodological issues, and then buliding scalable tools to improve interaction.*

> We're just starting this work, but have some exiting findings in press soon!

From our initial studies, it appears that the overall amount of matching, or even if the physician is the one who matches the patient most, does not matter as much to patients as the trajectory or change in matching over time throughout in interaction. Patients are more likely to rate their physician's style as similar to their own if the physician increases their matching over time. **We're calling this a linguistic accommodation process.**
