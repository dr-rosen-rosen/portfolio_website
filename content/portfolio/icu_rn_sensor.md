title: Sensor-based nursing workload measurement
weight: 0
---
Bedside ICU nurses work extremley hard. Sensors can generate insights into specific sources of workload, and, better strategies for management.

#### What we did
This was our earliest effort at using sensor-based measures in clinical care delivery areas. It was a massive learning curve for us, but extremely rewarding and promising as an approach to research and practical solutions. Main findings are available in a PLOS One article [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204819). 

1. In partnership with an innovative and intrepid group of nurses with a spirit 
2. Using sociometric badges from Humanyze (nÃ© Sociometric Solutions) 

#### What we found
> Sensor-based measures, which captured actual work processes, were a much better indicat of how mentally and physically taxing a shift was for nurses than the types of measures typpically used.

#### Why this matters

This was a proof concept study, and a learning experience for the team. But, it matters.
* Workload is a big fucking problem.
