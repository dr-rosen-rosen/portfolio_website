A series of projects aiming to understand end user needs and design solutions for anesthetists in medically austere environments.

#### What we did

We conducted a series of osbervational studies to elicit needs of those in the full system involved in using and supporting anesthesia machines including an  [FMEA with nurse anesthetists](https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzv030) and [clinical engineers](https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aeu096) in Sierra Leone.  [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzu053).

We also used simulation-based evaluations  [prior to deployment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2019.03.005) and  [In Situ simulations in the field](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2017.12.003).
as well as a robust evaluation of [clinical process and outcomes](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/FullText/2016/07000/Anesthesia_Practice_and_Perioperative_Outcomes_at.28.aspx) to inform future designs.
