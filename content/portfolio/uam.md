#### What we did

1. A series of osbervational studies to elicit needs of those in the full system involved in using and supporting anesthesia machines. [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzv030) FMEA of nurse anesthetists. [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aeu096). for maintenance and repair. [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzu053).
2. Simulation-based evaluations prior to deploymenet. [Here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2019.03.005).
3. In situ simulations in the field. [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2017.12.003).
4. Clinical paper. [Here](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/FullText/2016/07000/Anesthesia_Practice_and_Perioperative_Outcomes_at.28.aspx).
