Finding people who can thrive in long duration space exploration is tough. We're doing our part to find better measurement methods to identify those with the new right stuff.

The goals of our project are to develop and validate sensor-based and sociometric measures of individual and team competencies for long duration space exploration missions. This has been a long effort, and an active project since 2017. We're exploring physiology and communication based measures of teamwork, leadership, and 'team care'. 

We're collecting data in NASA's Human Exploration Research Analog ([HERA](https://www.nasa.gov/analogs/hera)) and other analog environments.

> Data collection will be complete in 2022!!
