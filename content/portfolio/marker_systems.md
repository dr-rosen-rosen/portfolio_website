Observational measures of teams remain important tools for research and improvement. We've developed several systems. 
<!--more-->
Here are examples of observational tools we've developed:

1. A simple tool for auditing the quality of pre-operative briefings can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1062860613509402).
2. We created a behavioral marker system for teamwork in the ICU, published [here](https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/FullText/2018/12000/Evaluation_of_a_Measurement_System_to_Assess_ICU.2.aspx).
3. We've made refinements to the above marker system to serve as a peer coaching tool for rounding in the ICU.
