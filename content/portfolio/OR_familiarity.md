Teams should be assembled to meet the specific needs of each individual patient.

The familiarity of team members with their specific tasks, and with one another is a strong predictor of outcomes across settings. The Operating Room is no different. 

#### What we're doing

1. Our first study in this area showed that the structure of intra-operative teams influences their adherence to best practices, and ultimately patient outcomes. Published [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2017.12.010).
2. There is a growing literature investigating familiarity and shared work experiences in intra-operative teams, as well as other aspects of team composition. We're doing a meta-anlaysis of all OR team familiarity literature. You can read the review meta-analysis protocol [here](https://osf.io/2t4yv/?view_only=106db2ae546b48aaaa1e8aae011cddc8), and the scoping review protoco [here](https://osf.io/saqyt/?view_only=c34c2ee105ba4f99b62222a6a657e047).
3. We have several ongoing operational and research projects in this area, including an analysis of all cases conducted within the Johns Hopkins Health System since 2016. **More to come soon!**


#### What's next

> We're working to generate the evidence needed to inform tools and processes to support design and scheduling of intra-operative teams. This approach can be extended beyond the Operating Room to a wide range of care delivery settings.
