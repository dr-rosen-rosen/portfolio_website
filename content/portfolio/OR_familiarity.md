#### What we're doing

1. Our first study in this area showed that the structure of intra-operative teams influences their adherence to best practices, and ultimately patient outcomes. Published [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2017.12.010).
2. There is a growing literaturre investigating We're doing a meta-anlaysis of all OR team familiarity literature. You can read the review meta-analysis protocol [here](https://osf.io/2t4yv/?view_only=106db2ae546b48aaaa1e8aae011cddc8), and the scoping review protoco [here](https://osf.io/saqyt/?view_only=c34c2ee105ba4f99b62222a6a657e047).
3. We have several ongoing operational and research projects in this area. More to come soon!
